# TEXAS SCHOOL SHOOTING SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS
According to CNN report, since 2009, at least 177 of Americaâ€™s schools experienced a shooting. These tragedies are as diverse as our nation, but the depth of trauma is hard to convey. There is no standard definition for what qualifies as a school shooting in the US. Nor is there a universally accepted database. 

In 10 years of shootings on K-12 campuses and found two sobering truths: School shootings are increasing, and no type of community is spared.
